# CY8CKIT-028-SENSE shield support library
The Sense Shield Board (CY8CKIT-028-SENSE) has been designed as a companion to add common sensors, audio components and user interface to an Arduino based baseboard.

See [README.md](README.md) for details on how to use this library.

### What's Included?
This library includes support for each of the hardware components included on the shield:

* OLED Display (SSD1306)
* Orientation Sensor (BMX-160)
* XENSIV Pressure & Temperature Sensor (DPS310XTSA1)
* 2 XENSIV MEMS Microphones (IM69D130V01XTSA1)
* PDM Microphone example code (SPK0838HT4HB)
* Audio Codec (WM8960)

### What Changed?
#### v1.0.0
* Initial release supporting the OLED display, orientation sensor, pressure sensor, and audio codec

### Supported Software and Tools
